# Introduction {#intro}

In progress. 
But for now, in case anyone manages to stumble across this repository, it is probably good to know a few things before you read ahead:

1. This transcription hasn't been proofread just yet so please do put on your critical thinking hats and evaluate the content. 
You can also [submit any issues as needed](https://github.com/MokeEire/BookdownISL/issues).
2. I am attempting to stay completely faithful to the text. 
It cannot be understated -- **this is not my work**, I am merely transcribing and learning. 
In a bid to use the authors' formatting, words in orange/red are related to `r data_colour("data")`.
In attempting to bring the user-friendliness of online books to the material, words in blue indicate `r keyword_colour("keywords")`.
In the book, these words are italicized and marked in the margins of the page.
