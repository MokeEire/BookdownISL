I (not an author) am compiling this book for myself as a learning exercise for both the contents of ISLR and the use of the [**bookdown**](https://bookdown.org/) package. 

From the [book's official website](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/):

>This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.

## Custom functions used throughout the book {-}

In order to make some of the tables and plots, I wrote some custom functions.
They are contained in the file [`visualization_functions.R`](https://github.com/MokeEire/BookdownISL/blob/master/visualization_functions.R), but here is a description of each function and why it is used.

### `theme_islr()` {-}

This is a plot theming function to mimic the figure style found in the book.

```{r theme-islr, eval=F, echo=T}
theme_islr = function(){ 
  
  theme_bw(base_size = 14, base_family = "Roboto") %+replace%    #replace elements we want to change
    
    theme(
      
      #grid elements
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),    #strip major gridlines
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),    #strip minor gridlines
      
      #text elements
      plot.title = element_text(             #title
        face = 'bold',            #bold typeface
        hjust = 0,                #left align
        vjust = 2),               #raise slightly
      
      plot.caption = element_text(           #caption
        hjust = 1),               #right align
      
      
      axis.text.x = element_text(            #margin for axis text
        margin=margin(5, b = 10))
      
      #since the legend often requires manual tweaking 
      #based on plot content, don't define it here
    )
}
```

### `prep_reg_table()` {-}

This function takes the output from an `lm()` object and formats it for regression tables.

```{r prep-reg-table, eval=F, echo=T}

prep_reg_table = function(reg_model){
  # Select the coefficients object from the summary of the regression model
  summary(reg_model)$coefficients %>% 
    # Convert it to a tibble, and make the rownames a column
    as_tibble(rownames = "term") %>% 
    # Rename the columns to match ISLR's tables
    rename(Coefficient = Estimate, 
           `t-statistic` = `t value`, 
           pval = `Pr(>|t|)`) %>% 
    
    mutate(
      # Replace the shorthand formulas given to lm() with regression publishing style
      term = str_replace_all(term, c("\\:" = " X ", # Interaction terms
                                     "I(?=\\()|[\\(\\)]" = "")), # Identity function
      # Create a p-value column which shows a less than sign in cases of very small p-values
      `p-value` = case_when(pval < .0001 ~ "<0.0001",
                            T ~ str_c(round(pval, 4)))) %>%
    select(-pval)
}
```
