<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Linear Regression</h1>
<p>You can label chapter and section titles using <code>{#label}</code> after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter <a href="intro.html#intro">2</a>. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter <a href="#methods"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This chapter is about <em>linear regression</em>, a very simple approach for supervised learning.
In particular, linear regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response.
Linear regression has been around for a long time and is the topic of innumerable textbooks.
Though it may seem somewhat dull compared to some of the more modern statistical learning approaches described in later chapters of this book, linear regression is still a useful and widely used statistical learning method.
Moreover it serves as a good jumping-off point for newer approaches: as we will see in later chapters, many fancy statistical learning approaches can be seen as generalizations or extensions of linear regression.
Consequently, the importance of having a good understanding of linear regression before studying more complex learning methods cannot be overstated.
In this chapter, we review some of the key ideas of the linear regression model, as well as the least squares approach that is most commonly used to fit this model.</p>
<p>Recall the <strong><span style="font-family:monospace; color: #B44C1C;">Advertising</span></strong> data from Chapter 2.
Figure 2.1 displays <strong><span style="font-family:monospace; color: #B44C1C;">sales</span></strong> (in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for <strong><span style="font-family:monospace; color: #B44C1C;">TV</span></strong>, <strong><span style="font-family:monospace; color: #B44C1C;">radio</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="font-family:monospace; color: #B44C1C;">newspaper</span></strong> media.
Suppose in our role as statistical consultants we are asked to suggest, on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will result in high product sales.
What information would be useful in order to provide such a recommendation?
Here are a few important questions that we might seek to address:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?</em><br />
Our first goal should be to determine whether the data provide evidence of an association between advertising expenditure and sales.
If the evidence is weak, then one might argue no money should be spent on advertising!</p></li>
<li><p><em>How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?</em><br />
Assuming there is a relationship between advertising and sales, we would like to know the strength of that relationship.
In other words, given a certain advertising budget, can we predict sales with a high level of accuracy?
This would be a strong relationship.
Or is a prediction of sales based on advertising expenditure only slightly better than a random guess?
This would be a weak relationship.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Which media contribute to sales?</em><br />
Do all three media - TV, radio, and newspaper - contribute to sales, or do only one or two of the media contribute?
To answer this question, we must find a way to separate out the individual effects of each medium when we have spent the mony on all three media.</p></li>
<li><p><em>How accurately can we estimate the effect of each medium on sales?</em><br />
For every dollar spent on advertising in a particular medium, by what amount will sales increase?
How accurately can we predict this amount of increase?</p></li>
<li><p><em>How accurately can we predict future sales?</em><br />
For every given level of television, radio, and newspaper sales, what is our prediction for sales, and what is the accuracy of this prediction?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is the relationship linear?</em><br />
If there is an approximately straight-line relationship between advertising expenditure in the various media and sales, then linear regression is an appropriate tool.
If not, then it may still be possible to transform the predictor of the response so that linear regression can be used.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is there synergy among the advertising media?</em><br />
Perhaps spending $50,000 on television advertising and $50,000 on radio advertising results in more sales than allocating $100,000 in either television or radio individually.
In marketing, this is known as a <em>synergy</em> effect, while in statistics it is called an <em>interaction</em> effect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It turns out that linear regression can be used to answer each of these questions.
We will first discuss all of these questions in a general context, and then return to them in this specific context in Section 3.4.</p>
